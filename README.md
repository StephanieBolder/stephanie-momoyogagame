# Stephanie Bolder - Momoyoga Game
This project is made for the company Momoyoga. Momoyoga offers software for yoga teachers, to make payments, appointments, etc. much easier for them.
The codes that I have written shows a solution to the problem they currently have: They currently only offer a service to yoga teachers, not yogi's.
